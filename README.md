This repository contains algorithms about:
* Solving differential equations (finite difference method)
* Solve nonlinear equations (Newton's method)
* Solve linear equations (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, CG methods)
* Domain decomposition method (overlapping: Schwarz alternating method; non-overlapping: Shure complement)

Involving:

CUDA, Pthreads, SIMD

(More specific information for each algorithm can be found in the .pdf or .JPG file in the same folder)
